**jumpstart**
===========================

A simple starter theme for WordPress. It is simpler and cleaner than the _s theme from WordPress, yet it has much more functionality, and a more sophisticated build process.

This theme is built for those who are going to custom code their sites.

About
-----

This theme comes out of the box with:
* SASS support
* Automated Gulp.js build process, with BrowserSync for live-reloading CSS, JS, and PHP
* Automatically generated Custom Post Types and Custom Post Taxonomy's
* Foundation
* Bourbon
* Many custom functions that I have put together over the years

Those who prefer CSS over SASS can throw out gulp files and SASS files. In your case, you will simply use `style.css`.

Folder Structure
----------------

Coming soon.

Install
-------

The Gulp build process is only for those who are major studmeisters:

After installing the theme into the themes directory, you can get the Gulp automated build process working by entering `npm install` into the CLI, from the themes folder. This will automatically load all of the required node modules. Finally, you will follow the instructions located in `gulpfle.js`.

TODO
